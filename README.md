# gh-pages for TreeBASE.org supertrees

Use "https://aiblaauw.github.io/Classname.html" to view html tree!

To do:

- Make index in which you can switch easily between html pages
- Preferably have ONE html page that interactively takes the right csv-file variable
- Have informative/interactive listing of TreeBASE studies for each node
- Visualize the scores from the score-column within the csv files to colors
